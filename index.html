<h3>  Introduction </h3>
In this article we are going to have an insight into the background of one of the most famous computer scientists and developers of the 20th century, and I am talking about the inventor of the Internet interface in the form of “WWW” which we are used to nowadays, Tim Berners-Lee (or also officially known as Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee). We will also consider his career, awards and of course inventions he is credited with.<p>
<h3>Childhood and Early Life</h3>

Tim Berners-Lee child of two mathematicians (Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee) was born 8th June 1955 in London.  From early childhood Tin Berners-Lee has shown an immense interest towards mathematics and electronics, and this inquisitiveness in science was stimulated by his two mathematician parents, who very often had discussed mathematic issues at home while working on the at the time revolutionary computer Ferranti Mark 1. He also gained inspiration from his endless passion to model trains he used to own as a child, tinkering them and at the same time learning about electronics, striving to apply new-learned information in the theretofore quickly emerging field of transistor technology. After moving from Sheen Mount Primary School to south west London's independent Emanuel School which he successfully graduated in 1973, he went to study at The Queen's College of the University of Oxford which he also finished with a triumph receiving a first – class degree in physics.

As soon as he finished his college he began to work as an engineer at the telecommunications company called Plessey. Having worked there for a two years he left Plessey and joined D. G. Nash Ltd, and afterward CERN where due to the complicated work related to the correlating information between big amount of different research teems he firstly designed application based on the idea of “hypertext” which he named Enquire. After again changing his work place and finally returning to CERN he encountered even more intricate situation and had to find a way for easier system of sharing documents. Thus he came up with idea of connecting Internet with concept of linked hypertext documents which led to the appearance of WWW. To animate his dreams he created Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Hypertext markup Language (HTML) and firs browser to make the proposed web visible. All this standards started to be widely accepted in 1991 after he opened his first web site (info.cern.ch). The World Wide Web began to proliferate with incredible pace.

<h3>Awards and Current Position </h3>
Tim Berners-Lee has received a lot of awards amongst which the most significant are knighthood in 2004 and Order of Merit. From the very beginning of his invention he always stood for free access to the Web for everyone without fees and patents. He founded World Wide Web Consortium to conserve the idea of royalty- free Internet. Nowadays he works with UK Government to help make data on Internet more available.
